# MyHyundai (unofficial) Home Assistant integration

This is a minimal custom integration that uses the
`hyundai-kia-connect-api` library to read vehicle status and trigger
remote start.

## Requirements

- MyHyundai (Korea) account with username/password login
- Home Assistant with custom component support
- OTP/2FA accounts are not supported in this version

## Install (git clone into custom_components)

```bash
cd /config/custom_components
git clone git@github.com:boramee/myhyundai-ha.git myhyundai
```

Then restart Home Assistant.

## Install (manual copy)

1. Copy this repository into a temporary folder.
2. Copy the files into `custom_components/myhyundai`.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search
   for **MyHyundai**.
2. Enter your MyHyundai email and password.
3. If your account requires a vehicle PIN for remote commands, enter it
   during setup.

If you have more than one vehicle, the setup will prompt you to select
which vehicle to add.

## Notes for Korea (MyHyundai)

The `hyundai-kia-connect-api` library does not expose a dedicated Korea
region selector. This integration uses the library's "India" region as a
fallback because the API endpoints are compatible for some accounts.
If login fails, the library may not currently support your account.
